# CIS-4500-Project

With many people having busy schedules, it may not occur to them to stop and listen to the birds around them, go out of their way to learn about the many different countries in the world, connect some of the environmental sounds that people and animals hear with the broader societal situation, or consider the connection between the natural world and economic and political situations. We plan to create a website that helps people increase their awareness and knowledge of the world through a fun trivia game that exposes users to facts about a variety of different countries and sounds of birds found in those countries. After hearing a bird song, the user will try and guess in which country it is found. Hints will be gradually given using World Bank information.
