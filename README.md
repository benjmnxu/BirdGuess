# BirdGuess

With so much of this generation being digitally wired, it may not occur to many people to stop and listen to the birds around them, go out of their way to learn about the many different countries in the world, connect some of the environmental sounds that people and animals hear with the broader societal situation, or consider the connection between the natural world and economic and political situations. We used data from the Xeno-canto bird sound database as well as the World Bank. We leverage a combination of economic, social, and political indicators of each country and the calls and locations of each bird to create an educational game which blends the natural world with the human-made one. Our website helps people increase their awareness and knowledge of the world through a fun trivia game that exposes users to facts about a variety of different countries and sounds of birds found in those countries.
